# Gtasks to Wunderlist

## Summary

Exports your gtasks to a Python file (via https://code.google.com/p/tasks-backup/), then use `export.py` to send them to Wunderlist (via wunderpy).

## Background

I've had tasks stuck in my gtasks for years. At a minimum, I'd like to pull all my tasks into one system.

Later I'd like to build a tool that helps me triage my tasks, so I trust that having them in this system will still make them useful, actionable.
